This makes React more lighter than Angular. This is a major advantage as well as a slightly minor disadvantage. The advantage is that you get the flexibility to use React in the way you want. You can use React with other frameworks like Angular or Vue.js. There are also many state management libraries like Redux and MobX that can be used with React. But for beginners, this becomes a bit difficult because you may end up messing the code without providing a proper file structure to your project, also you need to add other additional libraries like react-router which react does not provide by default.","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":5,"offset":735},"end":{"line":10,"column":652,"offset":1382}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":5,"offset":735},"end":{"line":10,"column":652,"offset":1382}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}],"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":686},"end":{"line":11,"column":1,"offset":1384}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"li","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"React is the View of MVC","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":8,"offset":1393},"end":{"line":12,"column":32,"offset":1417}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":4,"offset":1389},"end":{"line":12,"column":32,"offset":1417}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"When React was designed the Facebook community designed it in such a way that they provided us only the view.
